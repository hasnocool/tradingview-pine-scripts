**Tradingview Pine Scripts**
==========================

Hey there! I'm super excited to share this project with you. **Tradingview Pine Scripts** is an experimental trading simulation tool built using Python and Pandas.

**Description**
---------------

I built this to create a simple yet effective way to simulate trading strategies using TradingView's 1-minute data for the BTCUSDT pair. The script loads historical price data, simulates buying and selling based on closing prices, and prints out key metrics at each step of the simulation.

One cool feature is... well, there isn't one yet! But I'm thinking about adding more advanced trading logic, support for multiple assets, or even integrating with a TradingView API. Stay tuned!

**Features**
------------

* Simple trading simulation using TradingView's 1-minute BTCUSDT data
* Uses Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis
* Prints out key metrics at each step of the simulation (BTC bought/sold, USDT balance, etc.)
* Supports basic buy/sell logic based on closing prices

**Installation**
---------------

To get started, simply clone this repository and install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasnocool/tradingview-pine-scripts.git
cd tradingview-pine-scripts
pip install pandas
```
That's it! You're now ready to run the script.

**Usage**
---------

To run the simulation, simply execute the `trade_simulation.py` file using Python:
```bash
python src/trade_simulation.py
```
This will load the historical price data and start the simulation. Follow the output in your terminal to see how the script progresses.
